# Welcome to Chain4Travel 🌐
Chain4Travel is revolutionizing the travel industry by building the Camino Network, a layer-1 blockchain tailored for the travel sector. We are a global team of developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and travel experts working together to create a more efficient and interconnected travel ecosystem 🧳✈️.

## 🌉 Bridging the gap in the travel industry
Camino is designed to address the unique challenges faced by the travel industry. We leverage a three-chain architecture, forked from Avalanche, to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient platform for various use cases. Our blockchain network empowers validators, app developers, and stakeholders to create innovative solutions for the travel sector.

## 🚀 Our Blockchain Architecture
We have adopted a three-chain architecture with the fourth chain (for travel-related data) to be implemented after go-live. These chains offer a versatile foundation for various applications. Each chain is designed, optimized, and maintained as a fully independent system to cater to its intended use. This approach allows us to support a wide range of applications, from simple asset transfers to complex, EVM-compatible smart contracts.

* P-Chain: Designed for validators, this chain manages the network's consensus and staking.
* X-Chain: Ideal for app developers focusing on simple asset transfers and management.
* C-Chain: Supports more complex application scenarios requiring EVM-compatible techniques, such as smart contracts.
* T-Chain: As a new Virtual Machine it will introduce travel data standards to maximize connectivity with a high degree of security in GDPR compliant way
